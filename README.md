## Result

The game did not make it for the final deadline. We wanted a fully functional network game. Surprisingly that was up and running quite early, the most difficulty came from an open source library we used to allow everyone in the team to work on the logic and interface.

In the end the small difficulties and some added sickness made the game not due in time.
